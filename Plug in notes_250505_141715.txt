## Plug-in Architecture This project employs a robust plug-in architecture to enhance modularity, maintainability, and future extensibility. This design allows us to add, remove, or modify components of the application, and its interaction with Mini AI, without disrupting the core system. ### Rationale We chose a plug-in architecture for the following key reasons: * **Isolation of Concerns:** Plug-ins enforce a clear separation of concerns between different components, making the system easier to understand, develop, and debug. * **Modularity:** The system becomes highly modular, allowing us to change or replace specific parts (like the communication method with Mini AI) without affecting other components. * **Flexibility:** Plug-ins provide great flexibility for adapting to new technologies, integrating with different devices, or even swapping out entire subsystems. * **Testability:** Plug-ins can be developed and tested in isolation, making the overall system more reliable. * **Debuggability**: Plug-ins allow for an easier debugging process. * **Maintainability**: Plug-ins allow the system to be easier to maintain. ### `PlugInManager` The `PlugInManager` class is the core of the plug-in system. It handles the discovery, loading, registration, enabling, and disabling of plug-ins. * **Methods:** * `load_plugins(directory)`: Scans the specified directory for plug-in manifest files (`_plugin.json`), dynamically loads the plug-in code, and registers the plug-ins. * `register_plugin(plugin_name, plugin_class, manifest=None)`: Registers a plug-in, storing its class and other relevant information. * `enable_plugin(plugin_name)`: Enables a registered plug-in, creating an instance of it and calling its `initialize()` method if it exists. * `disable_plugin(plugin_name)`: Disables an enabled plug-in, calling its `deinitialize()` method if it exists. * `get_plugin(plugin_name)`: Returns an instance of the enabled plug-in. * `call_plugin_function(plugin_name, function_name, *args, **kwargs)`: Calls a specified function of a registered and enabled plug-in, passing arguments and keyword arguments. * `get_plugins()`: Returns a list of all registered plug-ins. * `get_enabled_plugins()`: Returns a list of all enabled plug-ins. * `get_disabled_plugins()`: Returns a list of all disabled plug-ins. ### `CommunicationBridgePlugin` Interface The `CommunicationBridgePlugin` is an interface that defines the contract for communication plug-ins. It ensures that all communication plug-ins (including `MiniAICommunicationBridge`) have a consistent set of methods. * **Methods:** * `send_event_to_mini_ai(event)`: Sends an event to Mini AI. * `receive_event_from_mini_ai(event)`: Processes an event received from Mini AI. * `initialize()`: Initializes the plug-in, establishing any necessary connections. * `deinitialize()`: Performs any necessary cleanup when the plug-in is disabled. * `get_name()`: Returns the name of the plugin. ### `MiniAICommunicationBridge` The `MiniAICommunicationBridge` is the initial implementation of the `CommunicationBridgePlugin` interface. It contains the specific logic for communicating with Mini AI. * It implements all the methods of the `CommunicationBridgePlugin` interface: * `send_event_to_mini_ai(event)` * `receive_event_from_mini_ai(event)` * `initialize()` * `deinitialize()` * `get_name()` ### Manifests Manifest files (`_plugin.json`) are used to describe each plug-in. They are used by the `PlugInManager` to load the plugins. * **Information**: The manifest files hold the information for: * `name`: The name of the plugin. * `version`: The version of the plugin. * `description`: A description of the plugin. * `main`: The name of the class in the plugin. ### Future Extensibility The plug-in architecture provides a powerful foundation for future growth: * **New Communication Methods:** We can easily create new communication plug-ins to interact with different devices or systems. * **New Application Modules:** We can add entirely new application modules as plug-ins. * **New Features**: If new features are needed, they can be created as plugins. * **Algorithm Collective:** The algorithms within the Algorithm Collective could also be implemented as plug-ins. * **Device/Platform Adaptability:** We can create new versions of core components as plug-ins for different devices or platforms. ## Mini AI's Serverless Nature Mini AI is designed with a focus on user privacy and data security. As such, it operates in a serverless manner unless specifically instructed otherwise. * **No Default Internet Connection:** Mini AI does **not** automatically connect to the internet or communicate with external servers. It performs its core functions entirely within the application's environment. * **Explicit Internet Access:** Internet access is only initiated when explicitly requested by the application. This means that any web searches, data lookups, or other internet-based actions must be specifically triggered by the application's logic. * **Privacy**: This helps to maintain the privacy of the user, as no information is shared without explicit requests. ``` ```text # Mini AI and Android Application This project outlines the development of Mini AI, a novel AI system, and its integration with an Android application. ## Key Concepts * **Mini AI:** A unique AI system based on a proprietary cognitive map algorithm. * **Cognitive Map Algorithm:** This is the core algorithm that drives Mini AI's reasoning and decision-making processes. * **Plug-in Architecture:** The application and its interaction with Mini AI are built using a flexible plug-in architecture. * **Serverless**: Mini AI does not automatically connect to the internet. * **Documentation**: The `design_notes.md` file holds important design information. ## Getting Started (Instructions on how to set up the project will go here as we develop.) ## Plug-in Architecture The project uses a plug-in architecture to promote modularity, flexibility, and maintainability.
